# FuzzyAIRacingGame
Simple AI using Fuzzy Logic for racing game

## Running
To run the application you need to clone the repo and run gradle task:
```
git clone https://github.com/maxiwoj/FuzzyAIRacingGame
cd FuzzyAIRacingGame
gradle execute
```

Fuzzy logic is used as a AI player in the game, but uses player's natural controls (uses buttons to control the car), so for the AI to work it is required to remain focused on the displayed window.
